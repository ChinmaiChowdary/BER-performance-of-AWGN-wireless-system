# BER-performance-of-AWGN-wireless-system

The MATLAB software with relevant toolboxes for developing MATLAB code is used for the simulation of the system. In this repository, the Bit Error Rate performance of different types of digital modulation techniques is evaluated by using MATLAB for FSK, PSK, BPSK, QPSK, and QAM modulation techniques. 
There are various kinds of channels used in wireless communication. Here, the AWGN channel is used between the transmitter and receiver. This repository focuses on the characterization and the design of analog signal waveforms that carry digital information and compares their performance on an AWGN channel.
